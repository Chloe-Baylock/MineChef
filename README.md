## About Mine Chef
Mine Chef is a website dedicated to my passion for mysweeper. I have wanted to code minesweeper for some time now, so making a website that can host a minesweeper game excites me. At the moment, Mine Chef is a forum for people to post about minesweeper. Users can also alter their profile picture and account details. Soon, it will include voting on posts, comments, adding friends, and direct messaging. Mine Chef will be a wholesome mineweeper community.

At the moment, Mine Chef allows for:

* Any user to create an account
* A user to log in or log out of their account
* Logged in users to view another user's account, as well as edit or delete their own account.
* Logged in users can view, create, edit, and delete posts
